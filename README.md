# wargames playthrough

This is mainly for me to take notes on how I got through each level of this games. Each game has it's own markdown file with details.

## bandit

The bandit game is a basic tutorial of unix/linux. It starts from `cat` and `ls` commands and goes deeper into permissions and even `git`.

A walkthrough of all the levels available (as of Jan. 4th, 2026) is in the `bandit.md`


## natas

This game is about the server-side web security and teaches how websites can be exploited when configured improperly.
